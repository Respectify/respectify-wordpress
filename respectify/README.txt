Healthy internet comments! Use Respectify to help your commenters post in a way that builds community.

== Description ==

Respectify helps you build healthy conversation on your site. Comments are analysed before being published,
and when users show common ways of writing unhelpful comments -- ones that don't contribute well to a 
good conversation -- Respectify shows feedback and lets them edit.

You can also enforce minimum requirements for comments to be published on your site, such as requiring that
comments not contain any potentially objectionable material.

Respectify's feedback is intended to encourage and teach good communication. It's not meant for censorship 
but for healthy engagement and understanding. We hope as your users write more comments, they will need
Respectify's feedback less and less.

Respectify is a commercial service (it's meant to benefit the world, but it costs us money to run) so
please [sign up for an API key](https://respectify.org).

== Installation ==

1. Go to the Plugins menu in the Wordpress admin interface, and select Add New Plugin
